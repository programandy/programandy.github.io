        <h1>My Life in Germany</h1>
        <p>
            I arrived in Germany on June 26, 2023, since I started speaking in german, I have lost the ability to
            communicate myself in English the way I used to, so I am so sorry if I make mistakes. I decided to make the
            webpage in English, so everyone I know could understand it.</p>
        <p>
            The most importat topic... Food!
        </p>
        <h3> Here is a list of my favorite food in Germany.</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Kochkeaseschnitzel</li>
            <li>Doener Pizza</li>
            <li>Spargel mit Bratkartoffeln und Speck oder Schinken</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The list is not that long, as i would like it to be.</p>
        <h3>Nature and Germany</h3>
        <p>Since I moved here, maybe because of the seasons, i have fallen in love with plants, trees and last but not least... flowers!</p>
